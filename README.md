# Space Invader

Project made by [@Bryan-Krausch](https://github.com/Bryan-Krausch) & [@Sik'](https://github.com/sikelio).

It uses [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) library to facilitate the system of collisions and other things.

To use the leaderboard, you have to setup you're MongoDB url in the code.
