# Space Invader

Project made by [@Bryan-Krausch](https://github.com/Bryan-Krausch) & [@Sik'](https://github.com/sikelio).

It uses [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) library to facilitate the system of collisions and other things.

To use the leaderboard, you have to setup you're MongoDB url in the code. (the current url is just an example url)

# Attention

We planned to create a leaderboard it will come soon ;)
